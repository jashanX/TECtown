                    <p style="display: none; color:black">Auto and tech companies are racing to get human drivers completely out of their self-driving cars, perhaps as soon as this year.
                    Numerous companies have been testing small fleets of autonomous vehicles on highways and city streets, yet, to date, nearly all of these vehicles have had test drivers or engineers inside, ready to take over should the unexpected happen.
                    One of the hottest discussion topics at this week's CES conference — formerly called the Consumer Electronics Show — is when companies expect to boot their so-called safety drivers out of their autonomous vehicles.
                    A Toyota executive explained how the Japanese automaker is aiming to demonstrate a true self-driving vehicle — one 	without a human babysitter — in time for the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics.
					Well before the summer games, General Motors has said it plans to have a fleet of driverless electric Chevy Bolts in certain urban areas as part of a ride-hailing service.
                    Mike Ableson, GM's vice president of global strategy, said Monday during a panel on autonomous driving that the company still aims to have these heavily modified Bolts up and running for commercial service sometime in 2019.
                    Gill Pratt, head of the Toyota Research Institute, told reporters that his company's future vehicle — a true self-driving car — would be considered "Level 4" autonomous.
                    Under a widely followed National Highway Traffic  Safety Administration classification system, a Level 4 autonomous car has the ability to drive itself most of the time, but still has a steering wheel and pedals for manual driving in bad conditions or for tricky maneuvers.
					By comparison, Cadillac's new Super Cruise function and Tesla's "autopilot" mode are considered Level 2 autonomy and allow for hands-free driving in many settings, such as freeways in good weather.

                        On the table before me are two diminutive robots, each emitting endearing little robot beeps and bloops, their screen eyes active. When I knock on the table, one of them turns to face the noise with surprising alacrity. The other just watches my face, turning slowly to keep me in focus as I move around.
                        These are prototypes for Vector, the latest robot from Anki, the company behind both the Cozmo and the Overdrive RC cars. I spent the day in Anki’s labs in San Francisco to learn just what Vector is and — critically — what it can do. When it ships in October for $249.99 (or cheaper for early Kickstarter backers), Anki will be marketing it as a “home robot.” It’s a sort of Cozmo for adults, a step beyond that robot’s learn-to-code toy ethos.
                        You can ask it questions, play games with it, and even pet it to elicit a chirpy little purr. But Anki doesn’t want you to focus on Vector’s functionality. The company has been putting a lot of effort into its personality. And because Vector is completely autonomous, you can do something completely surprising for a new piece of technology: just ignore it, and let it do its own thing.

                        Quantum computing is the area of study focused on developing computer technology based on the principles 
                        of quantum theory, which explains the nature and behavior of energy and matter on the quantum (atomic and 
                        subatomic) level. Development of a quantum computer, if practical, would mark a leap forward in computing 
                        capability far greater than that from the abacus to a modern day supercomputer, with performance gains in 
                        the billion-fold realm and beyond. The quantum computer, following the laws of quantum physics, would gain
                         enormous processing power through the ability to be in multiple states, and to perform tasks using all 
                         possible permutations simultaneously. Current centers of research in quantum computing include MIT, IBM, 
                         Oxford University, and the Los Alamos National Laboratory.
        
                        The essential elements of quantum computing originated with Paul Benioff, working at Argonne National Labs,
                         in 1981. He theorized a classical computer operating with some quantum mechanical principles. But it is 
                         generally accepted that David Deutsch of Oxford University provided the critical impetus for quantum 
                         computing research. In 1984, he was at a computation theory conference and began to wonder about the 
                         possibility of designing a computer that was based exclusively on quantum rules, then published his
                          breakthrough paper a few months later. With this, the race began to exploit his ideas. However, before 
                          we delve into what he started, it is beneficial to have a look at the background of the quantum world.
                          Quantum Theory
                        Quantum theory's development began in 1900 with a presentation by Max Planck to the German Physical Society, in 
                        which he introduced the idea that energy exists in individual units (which he called "quanta"), as does matter. 
                        Further developments by a number of scientists over the following thirty years led to the modern understanding of 
                        quantum theory.
                        

                        The Essential Elements of Quantum Theory:
                        Energy, like matter, consists of discrete units, rather than solely as a continuous wave.
                        Elementary particles of both energy and matter, depending on the conditions, may behave like either particles or waves.
                        The movement of elementary particles is inherently random, and, thus, unpredictable.
                        The simultaneous measurement of two complementary values, such as the position and momentum of an elementary particle, is
                         inescapably flawed; the more precisely one value is measured, the more flawed will be the measurement of the other value.
                        Further Developments of Quantum Theory
                        Niels Bohr proposed the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory, which asserts that a particle is whatever it is measured
                         to be (for example, a wave or a particle) but that it cannot be assumed to have specific properties, or even to exist, until 
                         it is measured. In short, Bohr was saying that objective reality does not exist. This translates to a principle called superposition 
                         that claims that while we do not know what
                         the state of any object is, it is actually in all possible states simultaneously, as long as we don't look to check.

                        Which ever argument one chooses, the principle that, in some way, one particle can exist in numerous states opens up profound implications for computing.

                        Microsoft surprised the world with the launch of its first-ever dedicated laptop in 2017,
                         the Surface Laptop. We almost immediately asked, why launch a laptop that’s straight down 
                         the middle when you’ve become the tastemaker in touch-led mobile computing?
                        As it turns out, the Surface Laptop 2 is an even more distilled answer to that question than
                         the first. While it doesn’t iterate on much, this sequel is frankly what the original model 
                         aspired to: a pure, powerful Windows 10 laptop experience.
                        Microsoft Surface Laptop 2 at Amazon India for ₹399999
                        Yeah, the Surface Laptop 2 could really use an updated port (or ports), given its somewhat 
                        untraditional 13.5-inch display. However, this lack of ports doesn’t hamper the Surface Laptop 2’s 
                        experience or utility. Instead, the internal improvements here make the Surface Laptop 2 worthy of 
                        your time and money, among the best laptops you can buy right now.
