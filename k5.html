                    <p>
                        Behold, the first “levitating” turntable is here. More precisely, it’s the platter of the new MAG-LEV Audio that hovers for a new, and supposedly enhanced, way of experiencing vinyl records.</p>
        
                        <p>“We were searching for a way to give people a better, newer way to experience vinyl records,” reads the concept design. “By pushing the frontier of audio technology, we were able to integrate the uplifting experience of music into the turntable design itself, bringing the feeling of zero gravity into your living room.”</p>
                        <p>The designers claim to have created a drive system that is completely unlike anything else on the market. Their patented technology has allowed them to not only achieve magnetic levitation but also introduce an “incredibly precise turning of the platter with sensor regulating software.” They argue that air is the smoothest medium, involving the least amount of friction, which further elevates the deck’s listening experience.</p>
        
                        <p>The visual effects of the levitation is expanded with orange, futuristic lighting that burns with the lights off. The turntable includes a cueing mechanism, speed select button, platter feet and a pre-fitted cartridge and tonearm that lifts at the end of the record.</p>
        
                        <p>The turntable is expected to ship in August 2017. You can support the project with a pledge via Kickstarter.
