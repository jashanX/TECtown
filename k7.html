                    <p>Xiaomi's upcoming flagship, the Mi 9 could be the first smartphone powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8150 according to supply chain sources. The Mi 9 will also sport the latest Sony IMX586 48 MP sensor for its main camera, up to 10 GB RAM, and an in-display fingerprint sensor making for an impressive spec sheet.</p>
			<p>Details of Xiaomi's upcoming flagship, the Mi 9 have started making their way online. GizChina quotes sources in the supply chain that say that the Mi 9 could be the first smartphone to be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8150 SoC. Sources indicate that the Mi 9 could launch sometime in the first half of 2019 in China.</p>

			<p>The launch date would more or less align with that of the Mi 8 that was launched in June 2018. The Mi 9 is expected to sport 6 or 8 GB RAM with a possible 10 GB variant in the offing as well. The other highlight of the Mi 9 is that it will feature a triple camera setup (a first for Xiaomi) and the primary shooter is likely to be equipped with Sony's latest IMX586 48 MP sensor. An in-display fingerprint sensor and wireless charging are also expected to make the cut.</p> 

			<p>The possibility of the Mi 9 being the first Snapdragon 8150-powered phone is somewhat uncertain. A host of OEMs including Samsung are expected to unveil new phones at the start of the year and by MWC 2019, we would have a pretty long list of phones sporting Qualcomm's latest flagship SoC. The Mi 9 would only be launching around May to June 2019 if the current Mi 8 timeframe is taken in account. However, there could be a possibility that the Chinese smartphone major could be pushing for an early launch window as well. We will get to know more in the days to come so stay tuned.</p>
