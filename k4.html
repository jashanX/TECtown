                    <p>The Mavic Air is half the size of a Mavic Pro, totaling at around 15 ounces. Funnily enough, it was introduced on Tuesday by Michael Perry, the executive of DJI, by pulling it from his pocket during the New York press event.</p>

			<p>For starters, the 3-axis gimbal camera with an angular vibration range that is reduced to 0.005 degrees. Because it’s set in a triangular formation, the gimbal dampeners ensure steadier shots have never been more possible.</p>

			<p>Horizontal, Vertical, and 180-degree panoramas aside, the 32 MP Sphere panoramas are 25 stitched photos that can also be viewed using the DJI Goggles for an immersive perspective beyond compare.
			The Mavic Air’s camera is 4K at 30 FPS, recording at up to 100 Mbps with exceptional UHD quality. Slow-motion video is also supported, as well. With slow-motion recording you get 1080p resolution at 120 FPS, great for capturing a high-speed adventure.</p>

			<p>HDR algorithm photos have their settings tweaked intelligently to match whatever lighting conditions are currently present. Dark or overexposed areas go through a process to find more natural transitions between the shadows and the highlights. The DSP acceleration ensures that your shooting will be more efficient than ever before with any drone.</p>

			<p>The Mavic Air’s camera pairs a 1/2.3” 12 MP CMOS sensor with an f/2.8 lens and a 35-mm focal length equivalent to 24 mm for shooting high quality videos and taking still photos.</p>

			<p>In addition to the Micro SD memory card slot, you get an additional 8 GB of internal storage that saves your videos and photos directly to the drone. You can export all of these files yourself using the USB 3.0 Type-C port.</p>
			<p>The geometric elegance of the Mavic Air is unstoppable and cannot be compared to any other drone. The arms fold into the aerodynamic chassis, while the magnesium alloy brackets are used to protect the seven onboard cameras. The rear vents dissipate the heat at an efficient rate, while the primary gimbal camera is recessed to ensure it’s properly protected.</p>

			<p>Speaking of foldable, the remote control is also foldable, as well! It has an ergonomic, low-profile design that holds your smartphone. The control sticks are detachable to ensure that you can store the controller just as comfortably on the go as the Mavic Air itself.

			The Mavic Air boasts a 21-minute flight time with a max speed of up to 68.4 kph when in Sport Mode. It comes with FOC ESCs and propulsion, not to mention enhanced WiFi video transmissions.</p>

			The new WiFi video transmission system has a support system of dual frequencies for 2.4GHz and 5.8GHz frequencies. It also supports a 720p live transmission view from up to 4 km away.
